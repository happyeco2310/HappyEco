Introduction
HappyEco is an application that encourages people to recycle more goods as mankind is continuing to generate vast volumes of garbage that can easily be recycled. But instead of recycling it, we are just duming it in the open.
Around 77% of the waste produced in india is disposed in open dumps, 18% is composted and just 5% is recycled.
We, here at HappyEco understand this problem and have created an informative application that encourages recycling by making people aware about the guidlines and important information.

Features
This app gives some locations of recycle plants in the city of the user.
It also provides pick and drop service which may be more comfortable for the user.
We are also trying to encourge more people by adding a point system for each time the user recycles, he/she gets a point, and at each 50 points the user gets a reward.
